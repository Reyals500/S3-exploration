# S3-exploration
This repo is checking out how to use AWS as well as S3 buckets
This is a repo to test out AWS to see how I can implement it into my CRUD solo project. This repo is also to add in how I implemented MUI to another previous assignment.

Amazon Web Services:
To set up AWS you have to first register for an account.
Then after registered you have to set up a bucket and from what I read you want to make it only available for the user and not of the public domain, unless you are setting up for a client.
I was reading the documentation and it was really dense so I was unable to get farther than setting up a S3 bucket. I am going to talk with my classmates and take a look over their way of AWS implementation to see if I can better understand it. Otherwise I have a friend who has worked with AWS and is willing to help show me.


Material UI
Material UI has a comprehensive list of components that can help style or fit anything that one may need. I used it on the movielist code to see if I could set up an autocomplete search functionality. I was able to get it into my code and get it to show all the different movie titles. However beyond that I was trying to implement it so that it could either be a way to go directly to the description page from the search or if you searched then it would render only those few movie titles that matched the descriptor.
